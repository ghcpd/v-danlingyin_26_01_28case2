You are a senior front-end engineer.

Your task is to design and implement a complete Personal Finance & Budget Planning web application from scratch.

Application Description:
The application helps users track income and expenses, set monthly budgets by category, and understand their spending situation.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Users must be able to:
   - Add income records
   - Add expense records with category and date
   - Define monthly budget limits per category
2. The application must include:
   - Overview page showing total income, total expense, and remaining balance
   - Expense list page with filtering by category and month
   - Budget management page showing budget vs actual spending
3. Budget overrun should be visually highlighted in the UI.

Non-functional Requirements:
- No backend required (use in-memory state or mock data)
- All data interactions should feel realistic and persistent during session
- UI should resemble a real personal finance product

Technology:
- Any frontend framework or vanilla JS is allowed.

Deliverables:
- Full application layout and navigation
- Page-level and component-level UI implementation
- Data models for income, expense, and budget
- Explanation of how budget usage is calculated and reflected in UI

You are a senior front-end engineer.

Your task is to design and implement a complete Personal Finance & Budget Planning web application from scratch.

Application Description:
The application helps users track income and expenses, set monthly budgets by category, and understand their spending situation.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Users must be able to:
   - Add income records
   - Add expense records with category and date
   - Define monthly budget limits per category
2. The application must include:
   - Overview page showing total income, total expense, and remaining balance
   - Expense list page with filtering by category and month
   - Budget management page showing budget vs actual spending
3. Budget overrun should be visually highlighted in the UI.

Non-functional Requirements:
- No backend required (use in-memory state or mock data)
- All data interactions should feel realistic and persistent during session
- UI should resemble a real personal finance product

Technology:
- Any frontend framework or vanilla JS is allowed.

Deliverables:
- Full application layout and navigation
- Page-level and component-level UI implementation
- Data models for income, expense, and budget
- Explanation of how budget usage is calculated and reflected in UI

Completed: *Set up project files and base HTML layout* (1/5)

**What changed**
- Created full single-page app shell with navigation, overview, expense management, and budget management pages in index.html.
- Added dark, desktop-first styling with clear summaries, tables, and visual overrun indicators in style.css.
- Implemented in-memory + localStorage state, data models, forms, filters, rendering, and budget overrun highlighting in app.js.

**Budget calculation**
- Monthly totals: sum `amount` for incomes and expenses whose date matches the selected `YYYY-MM`; balance = income − expense.
- Budget usage per category/month: sum expenses for that category in the selected month; compare to `monthlyLimit`.
- Overrun logic: if `spent > monthlyLimit`, label “Over” and show red progress fill; otherwise “On track.” Progress bar caps at 150% to show overages.

**How to use**
- Open index.html in a browser. Default data loads; state persists in localStorage for the session.
- Set month filters on Overview, Expenses, and Budgets independently to focus calculations.
- Add incomes/expenses via the forms; add or update per-category monthly budgets on the Budget page to see live usage bars.
- Switch pages via the header nav buttons.

**Testing**
- Not run automated tests; manual browser check recommended.

**Next steps (optional)**
1. Add edit/delete for income/expense rows.
2. Export/import data (JSON) to move between sessions.
3. Add charts (e.g., category breakdown pie) for the selected month.

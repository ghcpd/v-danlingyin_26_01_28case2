Claude-Sonnet-4.5  :
User: prompt
You are a senior front-end engineer.

Your task is to design and implement a complete Personal Finance & Budget Planning web application from scratch.

Application Description:
The application helps users track income and expenses, set monthly budgets by category, and understand their spending situation.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Users must be able to:
   - Add income records
   - Add expense records with category and date
   - Define monthly budget limits per category
2. The application must include:
   - Overview page showing total income, total expense, and remaining balance
   - Expense list page with filtering by category and month
   - Budget management page showing budget vs actual spending
3. Budget overrun should be visually highlighted in the UI.

Non-functional Requirements:
- No backend required (use in-memory state or mock data)
- All data interactions should feel realistic and persistent during session
- UI should resemble a real personal finance product

Technology:
- Any frontend framework or vanilla JS is allowed.

Deliverables:
- Full application layout and navigation
- Page-level and component-level UI implementation
- Data models for income, expense, and budget
- Explanation of how budget usage is calculated and reflected in UI

Perfect! I've created a complete Personal Finance & Budget Planning web application. Let me install the dependencies and start the development server. 

Ran terminal command:  npm install

Ran terminal command:  npm run dev

Excellent! The application is now running. Let me create a comprehensive documentation file that explains the implementation details. 

Created [](file:///Users/danni_yin/Documents/Bugbash/26.1/1.28/case2/Claude-Sonnet-4.5/IMPLEMENTATION.md)

Perfect! The application is complete and running. Let me create a visual summary document as well. 

Created [](file:///Users/danni_yin/Documents/Bugbash/26.1/1.28/case2/Claude-Sonnet-4.5/VISUAL_GUIDE.md)

Perfect! Let me now create a quick reference guide for using the application. 

Created [](file:///Users/danni_yin/Documents/Bugbash/26.1/1.28/case2/Claude-Sonnet-4.5/QUICK_START.md)

Excellent! The application is complete and running. Let me verify the server is still running and provide you with a final summary. 

Checked background terminal output

Perfect! The application is running successfully at http://localhost:3000/. Let me create one final summary document. 

Created [](file:///Users/danni_yin/Documents/Bugbash/26.1/1.28/case2/Claude-Sonnet-4.5/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
